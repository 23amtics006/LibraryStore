## ðŸ“š LibraryStore - Smart Book Management System

---

### Description

LibraryStore is a web-based **Smart Book Management System** built with **ASP.NET Core** and an **SQLite** database. It provides an intuitive platform for managing a library's book inventory, user accounts, and borrowing records.

**Key Features:**

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Supports separate roles for **Admin** and **User**.
    * **Admin (`admin@librarystore.com`):** Can manage books (Add, Edit, Delete), view all user accounts, and see all borrow/return records.
    * **User (e.g., om kavani):** Can register, log in, browse available books, **Borrow** books, and **Return** books via the "My Books" section.
* **Book Management:** Admins can add new books with details like Title, Author, and Genre. The database currently holds 27 books (e.g., "Clean Code", "Deep Learning").
* **Borrowing Records:** The system tracks which books are **Borrowed** (Return Date is NULL in DB, Status is 'Borrowed' in UI) and which have been **Returned** (Return Date present, Status is 'Returned' in UI).
* **Dashboard Overview:** An Admin Dashboard provides a quick summary: **3 Users**, **25 Books** (likely 2 were marked as test entries or deleted), and **4 Currently Borrowed** books.
* **Database:** Uses **SQLite** for data persistence, managed through Entity Framework Core. Key tables include `Users`, `Books`, and `BorrowRecords`.
